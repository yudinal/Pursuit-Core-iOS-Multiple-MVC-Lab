Let's practice making a tableView that segues to a detail page.

Inside this repo, you'll find a skeleton project with a ZooAnimal class outlined.

### Step 1:

Create and populate a tableView. The main text should be the name of the animal, the subtitle text should be the classification and the origin and the image should be the image of the animal.

### Step 2:

Create a custom tableview cell that contains an image, and two labels.  


### Step 3:

Create a detail view controller with a large image and all information about the animal on it. When you select a row in the tableView it should segue to the correct detail view. Don't forget to pass the object to the detail page in the segue.

### Step 4:

Use autolayout do make the detail view dynamic for different devices.

### Step 5: 

Use sections, with section headers for the different classification of animal. e.g. a section for mammal, bird, etc
